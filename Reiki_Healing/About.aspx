what do you have for the soul?” What can heal the soul from the trauma it has to go through
from various life challenges.

journey of self development in 2003 , which paved way to learn and explore the various
healing modialites, to engligten , empower and enrich the soul and help to evlove to reach the
higher purpose gave birth to Moksh,
