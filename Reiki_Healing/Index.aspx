            <p> <font size="4" color="#0b6d1a">I am a natural intuitive healer and reiki certified. I have worked with self-healing, self-inquiry and meditation for over twenty years and have been giving distance healings for more than ten years. I had a spiritual awakening in 1999 and a kundalini awakening in 2005. After the kundalini awakening, spontaneous healing started and is correcting a congenital birth defect. I am a published author and you can read my kundalini awakening testimonial for free at OurLightBody. 

From my experience, I learned that to be an effective healer of others I must first heal myself. Because of my self-healing efforts, I feel my skill as healer is very effective. Please read the testimonials from my clients.
