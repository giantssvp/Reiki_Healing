<b>Distance Healing:</b><br/>
</br>
This modality is the least experienced purely because it is “DISTANCE” and it is “ HEALING” .
Most of us are not aware of how an healing works, leave alone how can it work through
distance, followed by questions raised by our rational mind like what happens in healing? How
will it work? How will I know it works? Is this all true?
</p>
</br>
<p>
<b>What is Distance Healing?</b><br/> <br/>
To best answer this by example , Have you ever in your life thought of someone, something, it
could be anything a phone call from a loved one, thinking about a friend and they call or meet
you by “coincidence”, sometimes when you look at somethings you “know” it will work or “it wont
work” without knowing how you know it. Have you ever heard of “telepathy” and understand how
it works - 
Then this is a proof that energies connect in distance, you thinking
about someone or something and they reciprocating at the same time is nothing but strong
energetic connection towards the person or event that they just come across as coincidence.

</p>
<p>
Likewise, Universal energy has no boundaries,like the light,sun, moon air,sky , flowing water
has no boundaries Distance Healing has no boundaries. It is mere tapping those universal
vibrations and passing them through to someone who needs it the most at a given point in a
time.
</p>

<b>What happens in a session:</b><br/><br/>
A practionier is a channel to draw the energy from the Universe to an individual mind, body and
spirit, the energy is so subtle , yet powerful that changes reflect almost immediately after a
session.
Individual / client is expected to dedicate the committed time to healing so they can feel a
connection to the energy and experience for themselves how the energy flows. It is best if the
client is aware of things prior the session to better gauge the changes the energy brings in their
life.

You are expected to dedicate the committed time to healing so you can feel a connection to the

<p>

<b>Will the practioner know what is happening in my life? </b><br/><br/>

The answer is NO, Practioners are indiviudlas who are attuned in healing and in healing the
practionier is a medium to channelise the energy into areas of life where healing is required the
most The energy are so subtle are strong and more towards client needs that the clients may
get impressions and feeling about the areas they need to work up or move on instead of the
practionier.
</p>
<br/>
<p>

<b>How will I know the practionier is true and is commited for the session?</b><br/> <br/>
No practionier will risk the energy flow within themselves for money, as nothing is hidden from
the Universe. So rest assured if a practioner has committed time for a session the healing
begins at that time.
</p>
<p>

All sessions are confidentatl that even the practioner doesnt need to know the current state of
mind of an individual, all they need to know is the client willingess to experience the enegy and
readiness to change thier life situtations, it is for the client to know the difference and get the
result.
